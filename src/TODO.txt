--------------- TO DO ---------------
7) Path render, while displaying them set ball not being able to be clicked


------------- BUGS ----------------
1) Pathfinding starts to look at nodes further away 
    from the end after having a ball as its neighbour


--------------- STUFF DONE (SCORING) --------------
Base (max 100%): 
    50% - separate files, OOP + types
    20% - static, midificators, scopes (public), interfaces
    20% - using a module loader

Points (max 5p):
    [L1]
        1.5p - working pathfinding algorithm
    [L2]
        0.25p - random ball generation
    [L3]
        0.25p - display and placement of random balls

Total: 90% * 2p = 1.8p
